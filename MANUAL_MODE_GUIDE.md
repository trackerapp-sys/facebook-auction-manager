# Manual Mode Setup Guide
## Running Facebook Auction Manager Without Business Registration

Since you don't have a registered business, here's how to set up and use the auction management system in manual mode.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (No Facebook Business Required)

### 1. Environment Configuration

**Server (.env file):**
```env
# Basic Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/facebook-auction-manager
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this

# Disable Facebook Integration
FACEBOOK_INTEGRATION_MODE=manual

# Optional: Leave Facebook settings empty
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=
FACEBOOK_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=

# Client URL
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Client (.env file):**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_ENV=development

# Optional: Leave empty for manual mode
REACT_APP_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=
```

### 2. Start the Application

# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start both server and client
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Application

## üìù How to Use Manual Mode

2. **Click "Register" tab**
3. **Create an account** with:

### Managing Bids Manually

Since Facebook integration is disabled, you'll manage bids manually:

#### Option 1: Direct Bid Entry

2. **Use "Add Manual Bid" feature** (admin/auctioneer only)
3. **Enter bidder information**:
   - Bidder name
   - Bidder email
   - Bid amount
   - Source (Facebook, Phone, Email, In-person)

#### Option 2: Monitor Facebook Manually
1. **Post your auction** in Facebook groups as usual
2. **Watch for comments** with bid amounts
3. **Copy bid information** into the system manually
4. **System handles** all validation and notifications
